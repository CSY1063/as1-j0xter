            <p class="projectDesc">In 2011 I worked on NASA's curiousity rover, the most capable and largest rover ever
                sent to Mars, it was insane. I did some electrical work and stuff, very important things like connecting
                the wires and making sure wheels spin. Without me I think it wouldn't have been possible.</p>

            <p class="projectDesc">I was an intern at Google in 2020, nothing interesting happened. Overrated to be
                honest, they talked about marketing and things. Overall experience was 6/10. LOOKS GOOD ON A CV
                METHINKS.</p>

            <h1 class="projectTitle">FREELANCE ANIMATOR</h1>
            <p class="projectDesc">In 2019 I was bored during Covid-19, so I downloaded blender one afternoon and
                learned rigging and animating, then I went on Fiverr and did some commissions and whatnot, it got boring
                very fast because I discovered I actually hate animating, and the camera in blender made me nauseous.

            <h1 class="projectTitle">'GAME' DEVELOPER</h1>
            <p class="projectDesc">Shortly after blender I tried out a few game engines, Unity, Unreal and GameMaker. My
                friend happened to know Unity so he explained a game concept to me and we decided to work on it a little
                bit, I used some C# within Unity. Interesting language, also taught me Object Oriented Programming which
                came in clutch for the programming module in University, although I forgot quite a lot.</p>

            <h1 class="projectTitle">STUDENT</h1>
            <p class="projectDesc">I was actually a student throughout most of my life, and I consider it one of the
                longest standing positions I've ever had, still am a student currently. I am doing a Software
                Engineering degree at the University of Northampton. I have been enjoying it so far not gonna lie, lets
                hope it stays that way. Also the Web Development module is pretty cool as well, lecturer is a calm guy.
