            <h2 class="reportHeader">Reflection of module experience</h2>
            <p class="reportText">This section will cover a somewhat detailed report of my experiences learning web
                development along with some problems and challenges I have faced along the way.</p>
            <h3 class="reportHeader">How did I find the module?</h3>
            <p class="reportText">
                Overall, the module was good I definitely enjoyed it despite some challenges. Having tried HTML and CSS
                in the past it
                was interesting learning new approaches to creating website layouts, I found CSS to be enjoyable when it
                came to styling the actual content on the page. I found the lecturer to also be very enthusiastic which
                kept the module interesting as well.

                I will definitely continue trying new things with both HTML and CSS to develop my understanding a lot
                further, as well as make changes to this continuously where I see fit.
            </p>
            <h3 class="reportHeader">Design Choices</h3>
            <p class="reportText">
                Some of my design decisions stemmed from the lectures themselves, particularly one of the exercises we did
                in class which was to create a very basic website using a grid layout, I used this as a foundation for
                the layout of my website, having a header across the top with a navigation bar underneath, the main
                content was displayed in the centre of the page and there is a footer at the bottom. I decided to use
                this layout because not only was it a requirement for the assignment, but also because it is a fairly
                contemporary and conventional layout for a website.
            </p>

            <p class="reportText">
                The main source of inspiration for the overall theme of my portfolio actually came from OperaGX, which
                apparently is a browser catered for avid video game enjoyers or something along those lines. I
                personally have never used the website, but thought that the theme and look it had was very interesting,
                it felt very technical and futuristic. Ergo, I decided that I would take a similar approach, by adding
                certain neon elements to my page such as glowing borders and gradients to the main body of the page with
                my own colour palette that I picked out using a website called Adobe Color
            </p>

            <p class="reportText">
                I also ended up using a total of four fonts in my entire assignment, I acquired these from Google Fonts
                each one intended to fit the theme that I was going for with my design, I also included a few icons from
                Font Awesome within the footer of my pages, while these have no functionality as of yet I decided to add
                them there because generally every website has these at the bottom, these can be links to social media
                pages or external sources that users can navigate to easily without having to search specific URLs.
